# word-unscrambler-game

Welcome to the Word Unscrambler Game! This interactive game challenges players to unscramble words and test their vocabulary skills. 

This repository contains both the backend and frontend of the game. The backend is built on Node.js using Express.js. The frontend is built using React.js with Vite, and the UI is styled using Tailwind CSS with components from daisyUI.
